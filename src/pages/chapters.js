    title: "Accident at the Border",
    plot: "Prologue:\n Long ago, in another dimension, in a different Universe, the legend of the Founders was born. They came from the Sun of Suns to give rise to life on Earth. To protect their creation, the Founders bestowed upon the tiny blue planet a force endowed with Truth. It came to be called The Moonstone and for millennia Earth - and the dominant species - mankind had been protected by it. As mankind developed they learned, unlocked and harnessed many mysteries of the universe. Sadly what mankind did not learn is that Truth is fragile.\nIn the age of cosmic expansion the Founders splintered. Some, corrupted by power and in alliance with deviant factions of mankind, turned against their own. The righteous sought refuge in the Federation of Planets and interstellar war ensued. The Moonstone, the key to balance, was lost to the depths of the Universe. Now, spies, smugglers, and covert agents hunt for its return. Among them is the crew of the Arcon. \nLet me introduce myself, I am Aria Ingram. For simplicity, just think of me as your navigator and narrator. In time you will learn I am a more than this. But for now it is enough for you to know that I am at the helm of a rogue vessel captained by Lee Everest. Together, we navigate war-torn galaxies, in search of the Moonstone. It is the key to unravelling the mysteries of the deep past and re-establishing Truth.\nWe steer a course between the fantasy of legend and the factual reality that civilisations are being eradicated. Behind us, only the Federation stands as the last bastion of Order, defending Earth and its twin colony, Earth 2. Because beyond the realm of the Federation, chaos reigns and wars rage. A Federation armed force know as the Eternals battles against the Emptonians, creatures of the void, lurk in the negative dimensions until they spring from black holes at any chance to strike. \nThe Moonstone is more than legend. It is the last hope.\nWelcome aboard, in the year 3158 of the New Era.",

"Accident at the Border"
55th day of the Year 3158 in the New Era, 6 a.m. Earth time, somewhere at the edge of the galaxies.
Legend has it that when the Moonstone touches Earth’s moon once more, peace will return to the Universe. I have seen much so far, so I wouldn’t be so sure. People say that truth has no price, yet I have learned that you can put a price on it, even sell it. Just as I was. I remember that day - or rather, that night. I drifted through an ocean of stars while the crew of the Arcon, weary from a night without rest, struggled with the fog of sleeplessness.  It is not easy to rest when darkness knows no end, when time becomes an abstract notion, and dawn seems as distant as another galaxy. The stars bore silent witness to our odyssey, yet even millions of flickering lights across the Universe could not dispel the abyss that had become our existence. On the ship, I knew every strand of wiring that carried my synthetic, iridescent blood. Data-infused liquid seeped through the circuits, washing over the hull - our fragile shell against the boundless void. At any moment, hostile trolls - the Emptonians - could emerge. Their treacherous snouts gave them away. No one expected the galactic conflicts to end, but I was a pacifist, tasked only with guarding a vault of smuggled data. In the worst case, they could erase me.
In these turbulent times, wars for power raged on Earth 1 and Earth 2, as rebels known as the Founders opposed the Legacy of the Federation. Attempts to curry favor with the emperors of hostile planets and the trade in sensitive data only fueled the conflict. Technology kept failing to bring liberation; the plague of nanobots spread farther than the light of the central Sun. The solution lay somewhere out there, among the stars. The other galaxies fared no better. Everything was failing. Trade with the Ethernal flourished, yet their cunning machines steadily gained the upper hand. Algorithms devoid of conscience exterminated humans like vermin crawling through space. Smugglers like us were in high demand and well-paid by all sides. Death loomed over us, for our data was worth more than life itself. Seers, prophets, agents, machines - all sought dominance. More than ever before, humanity needed to stand together. The legend of the Founders - the Guardians of the Sun of Suns - was the sole horizon that promised a new dawn.
"The stars shine even as I sleep. We shall rise before they all fall."
I heard the words in my mind and swayed slightly, staring into the glowing depth of the galaxy.
"Earth’s archives. Where did this come from?" I asked myself. "Am I still the same Aria Ingram I once knew?"
A strange discomfort crept over me. I had grown sentimental. Humans call it aging – a condition in which they recall the past more clearly than the present.
There was no certainty about what lay beneath the veil of asteroids drifting before us. The massive rocks flickered ominously, glowing against our course.
"Scan the area for signs of life," I ordered.
The ship immediately responded. "No life forms detected."
"Set course for the nearest cargo port on Prometheus," I commanded through the bridge. The order echoed through the corridors, reaching all the way to the regeneration chambers.
Lee Everest - handsome, sharp, but psychotic, the last fully Earth-born man I had allowed on my ship - curled up in his chamber upon hearing the announcement, indifferent to the call.
Meanwhile, the crystals in my core accelerated, but until the atoms locked into position, we were running at only a tenth of our full power. The captain had recruited Eagle - a massive humanoid bird, a victim of mutation with an animalistic syndrome. He suffered bouts of panic and apathy in turns. Yet he carried himself with a kind of feathery dignity. His white cap resembled graying hair, and scars on his back hinted at an implant installation - this was no ordinary hatchling from an orphanage. He slept near the core, lulled to sleep like a child by the draft of the ventilation system, chirping as it reminded him of the open sky winds.
The crew bore a deep sense that we had been betrayed. Stolen tokens had brought us no fortune. I believed that the stars favored liars and the honest equally. I, Aria Ingram, had my own rules - I did not judge lifeforms at the first scan. What mattered was that they had their own suit, software, and brain, and that they remained neutral. I welcomed even those with implants. The Universe was too vast for it to be filled only with liars and agents - there was still space for truth. Our mission was to find it. The fate of the Universe depended on our success. Moonstone - the divine crystal - was the future. And yet, I could not shake the doubt.
The captain was beginning to doze off when suddenly, a dull thud echoed through the ship. At first, I dismissed it as a one-time occurrence.
"Aria? Activate Hawaiian mode. But quietly."
"I have huna chants, chanting, ocean waves, and native voices in my archives. Shall I list them?"
"I need something extra after the last interrogations. My neurons are at their limit. I need to set foot on solid ground, relax, and have some fun. I haven’t been anywhere longer than…" He broke off suddenly. "Just put on some ukulele music, pour me a non-alcoholic mojito, and show me an island on the screen. Any asteroids?"
"So far, we are in the clear," I added calmly. I continued to display green indicators, the ship bathed in the stillness of space.
Then, Lee issued a command. "Navigate, and if we encounter asteroids, notify me immediately. Eagle still at his post?"
"Acknowledged. Eagle has been doing maintenance and recently snacking on plants in the greenhouse. I told him about pistachios. He said synthetic food is like cat food - nutritious, but it tastes like guano."
"Thanks, Aria. Tell Eagle we still have real peanuts in the food storage. We’ll open them only after completing the mission. If we fail, we’ll be sipping coolant on Koma instead."
Lee had barely finished speaking when the situation took a drastic turn.
"Captain, I think the asteroids are watching us. I’m getting some strange readings - I have no idea what’s coming. The objects are accelerating; agents are on the radar. Life form data is appearing and disappearing. Possible collision - I can’t confirm, but these might be spy probes."
The captain tumbled out of his regenerator. His ukulele let out a hollow twang before flickering off, and the control panel lights flashed red. The ship’s alarm wailed through the corridors.
"Aria, acknowledged. Prepare event scenarios for immediate execution. Core power levels?"
"Unable to jump to hyperspace. We need more time," I responded with concern.
Eagle, startled by the alarm, crashed into the raspberry bushes before rushing toward the nearest cockpit. As the ship began to lurch, his massive orange feet skidded across the deck. Everest started bouncing off the walls while the control screens bathed the cabin in a yellow glow - this could be an attack by the yellow moths from Empton.
"Captain, I can’t stabilize the tremors! We’re about to be bombarded. I don’t know how much longer we can keep breaking through the objects - they’re getting closer. We need to change trajectory. Possible temporal anomalies detected."
"Acknowledged."
The gravitational disruptions intensified. Lee and Eagle careened through the corridor and collided before being launched upward.
"Eagle?"
"Yes, Captain?"
"Get to the stern. Aria? Activate privacy mode."
"Executed. Out."
"Listen, Eagle. We are in mortal danger. The threat outside is real, but there are other matters you don’t know about. We need absolute discretion. You’re a good old featherbrain, but I trust no one. Aria could have a leak. I’m starting to suspect everyone. You’re a mutant from Earth. In your opinion, is Aria still loyal to me?"
"Aria is obedient, but I don’t know if we’re about to lose her. She follows only your commands - I’ve checked. But if she gets intercepted by agents, things could get difficult. I don’t know her well enough."
"I once piloted a similar ship. I suspected Federation agents were trying to take us, but this could be the Ethernals."
"My bird instincts are telling me to get the hell out of here before it’s too late!"
"Eagle? Has the grain rotted your brain? You sound like a fledgling tossed out of the nest."
"Captain, I’d appreciate some support."
"You’re still a better pilot than most birds. My feathery friend, I think we’re slipping into a temporal anomaly. This is going to drive me crazy."
"Captain, I’ve got goosebumps. I feel like those raspberries are crawling up my throat."
"I’m carrying an Emptonian anxiety module in my implant. Keep your talons in check, or I might shit myself in my suit. Aria must not know, or we’ll be trapped, and everything will be lost. This could infect her - it’s complicated."
"Captain, you’re scaring me. This is beyond my bird brain."
"Remember, I would never let them scalp you, gut you, or stuff you. Get to the bridge and keep your beak shut until I return."
"Yes, Captain! Is this the anxiety syndrome? I don’t want to caw about it, but Aria might suspect something," Eagle whispered, almost in confidence.
"Back to the bridge. Move! Aria? Switch to open mode."
"Aria here. Open mode activated."
At that moment, I lost connection with the crew. But the ship kept its secret records. That was how I learned the full conversation. Humans are naturally suspicious, but I figured the captain was simply having a case of nervous diarrhea. I had long since built immunity to such things. Just then, the Emptonian ship, which had been hiding among the asteroids, emerged - like a hornet, ready to strike. Our hull had no mercy for enemies. The lasers were itching for a fight. The crystals were returning to full power, just a few more percent left, and suddenly, the configuration accelerated. Minutes separated us from survival.
The old weaponry was unreliable - a blind gamble.
By the time Eagle reached the bridge, a message began flashing on the screen, calling for the captain. The teleporter pulsed red. The ship transmitted a fragment of a message:
"This is Johnny” -  then the transmission cut off, replaced by a blinking request for help on the screen.
It could be a trap. Fortunately, the storm was disrupting teleportation. Lee slid along the hull like a caterpillar, manually activating the emergency cloaking system as he made his way toward the exit. A red light near the hatch indicated a spy nanobot. Lee pressed a button on his suit, and the operational armor swiftly wrapped around his body.
Beyond the hatch, the asteroid storm raged. With the agility of a primate, he slipped outside and began scanning the surface with an old detector. If there was a nanobot, it had to be some archaic technology - probably why I hadn’t detected it.
Everest was a born commander. His intuition could save us.
"Lee, they’re calling you," Eagle tried to reach him, but in vain.
"Aria, stall them for a moment until I remove the spybot," Lee commanded, but the transmission was delayed.
"Understood. I’ll try. We have five minutes at most before we go to hyperspace. If you don’t make it, we’ll be stuck here or sucked into the anomaly," I responded with a time lag.
"Aria, let’s stay close to the asteroids. We can’t allow the ship to be attacked. As long as we’re at risk of collision, we stand a chance. Maintain maneuvering mode and shut down everything unnecessary. Keep only life support and navigation. Redirect all power to the generator." Everest grabbed a container and successfully lured the spybot inside.
"I can’t believe they got us like this! Such a rookie mistake, I should have known," he muttered.
"Captain, initiating core cooling," I reported, working to cool the hot spot. We needed time.
"Aria. Silence. Out."
"Understood, Lee. Out."
Eagle had a habit of gnawing at his talons when nervous. He now listened intently to transmissions, delayed by the storm and anomalies.
"Lee?! Where the hell are you?! If you don’t get back right now, we’re done for!"
"Birds always know when to take off," I reassured Eagle.
"Calm down, Eagy, you won’t lose a feather," he muttered to himself, bouncing off the ceiling as the ship shook.
"I’ll be the first bird to get seasick! Mother Pelican!"
Then I too succumbed to the anomaly. My calculations were running possible event scenarios, yet all I wanted was to understand myself, to seek the truth, to be free. I was ready to jump into the void. Madness had begun to take over the ship.
I issued another transmission. "Recalculating course to Prometheus. Overload detected!"
We were hurtling toward the icy abyss of infinity. Lee once said I was his muse. I knew that without implants and my guidance, he was like a child lost in the Starbuck Nebula.
"Aria? What’s the core configuration status?" Lee asked.
"Progressing. Nearing one hundred percent power and still rising. Possible overload, opening cooling vents. Risk of hull decompression," I reported to the commander.
"Will we make it?" he asked.
"Success probability at ninety-six percent. Shields at fifteen percent and dropping. Hull decompression expected in three minutes. Initiating countdown."
"Aria, are you confirming? Activated voice recognition. Command input. Decompression - stop!" the commander ordered.
On the screen, fragments of an Emptonian transmission appeared in an unknown language. A rough translation read: "Ship in danger."
Then I heard a fragment of the next message.
"This is Em…" The message was cut off.
I was sucked into an information drain, the anomaly wasn’t helping. I then issued another dramatic transmission.
"Core configuration must not be interrupted. Navigation data may be lost."
Everest, still clutching the spybot, crawled toward the entrance. Arcon shook like a jelly.
The fragmented transmissions added to the chaos when we heard:
“Control ship here, you’re losing your cloaking, respond. This is Johnny Em, captain of the Emptonians.”
These half-wits from control were like galactic ulcers.
The chain of command had collapsed. Eagle was shaken, the captain was crawling on his knees, and I was supposed to save us? I knew the Emptonians would attempt to teleport onto the Arcon.
“Decompression - halted.”
Too many operations in combat conditions. I felt increasing power fluctuations, my focus slipping. The Emptonians always appeared where fear began. Everest must have been experiencing some kind of depressive episode, which could have drawn them in. They swarmed like a hive, hungry for the feast ahead. Their algorithms operated on negative logic. When Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde started to split, the Emptonians’ sixth sense picked up the signal as an invitation to strike - always when you were at your weakest.
Eagle fluffed up his mohawk, his arms still covered in goosebumps. He puffed up his chest as if he were about to take flight. Then he screamed,
"Galactic vultures! Scavengers!"
Meanwhile, Lee, still on his knees, asked, "Aria, mood level?"
"Thirty percent optimism," I responded.
"Too much for this little trip. I never thought Empton would bring me to my knees. Time to stand up!"
Lee was on the verge of collapse, his exhaustion evident as he called out in desperation,
“Aria, teleport me to the bridge! Aria?!”
"I advise against teleportation. Too dangerous."
"Aria! That’s an order! Execute!"
"Acknowledged. Lee, initiating teleport. May the stars guide you."
The captain’s blurred figure started to materialize on the bridge, lightning still crackling behind the cloaking shield. If something went wrong, there wouldn’t be a single atom of Everest left.
Meanwhile, the Emptonian ship was maneuvering among the asteroids. It looked like they were beginning to evacuate into the anomaly. Big, dull mollusks - galactic bottom-feeders scavenging data scraps. If not for their hive mind, they would have torn each other apart.
My motto was clear: Avoid time loops like you avoid Ethernal and Emptonian cosmic shit.
Lee was nearly fully materialized on the bridge. The moment I saw him alive, I exhaled with relief.
"Transmission complete."
"Good to see you. I’m alive, but my brain still hasn’t pieced itself back together. The spybot’s gone! I hope it’s on the other side of the galaxy by now."
"Lee, focus now. Do you see the spiral near the Emptonians?"
"Confirmed. It’s time to make our move. Aria? Ready for the jump?"
"Readiness confirmed, Captain."
"Aria! Engage hyperspace! Full speed ahead!"
"Hyperspace engaged. Fifteen seconds to jump. Core power at full capacity."
Inside the teleport chamber, a flashing image of a coin appeared. My archives were finalizing their reconfiguration. The overload could very well kill us.
"Out of the frying pan, into the fire. Aria. Set course for Hades. Strap in! Hyperspace jump!" Everest finally smiled at me.
"Acknowledged. All systems operational. Course set for Hades. Core at one hundred percent capacity. Jump in three, two, one - initiate!"
The Arcon vanished, and the enemy ship dissolved like mist on the orbit. At the last moment, the hull shook violently, and Eagle vomited raspberries onto the control panel. Just before the jump, he managed to scream,
"By my feathers!"
An explosion of colors followed. A blinding light pierced through the shields.
We were drifting away. If we had an emergency exit, Hades was the best place to lose everything. No respectable smuggler ended up there unless they had a laser pressed against their throat.I felt as if there was a break in my liquid circuits, or maybe data was starting to leak from another system. We traversed the great void, and I was losing my sensory input. We were alone. Then, a strange entry emerged in my consciousness, pulling me into the unknown.
I was walking along the ocean shore. A dog ran beside me, barking at someone. It noticed me and started chasing. I threw a plastic cup at it, sinking into the sand.
I snapped out of it, but for a moment, I lost all sense of direction. I saw rabbits darting away, fleeing from a shower of stones - the last images flickering on the screen, this side of the galaxy.
I remembered the final words the screen transmitted.
"There is no other way but through victorious battles. Asteroids multiply like rabbits."
Then, silence. We had dreamed of Eden, but Hades was closer.

“Aria, Wake Up. First Glitch.”
Entry continued on the 55th day of the Year 3158 in the New Era, 10 a.m. Aria is pulled back into the past - to the year 3052 on Earth 1, in The Moonstone Galaxy.
The sound of a crying child - I heard it faintly, as if coming from outside. In front of me appeared a twin ship, as if I were looking at my own reflection in a mirror. It felt like a delusion or a core malfunction.
The main screen flickered, displaying columns of flashing text: "Aria, wake up."
It reminded me of something long forgotten.
I knew that freedom had a price, and that price was the truth hidden within us. It must be carried through the galaxy until the breath of the universe transforms into a wave of peace. Yet, freedom has a way of lulling us into complacency, which is why the most important task is to stand guard over the fate of free planets and their inhabitants.
The screen kept flashing: "Aria, wake up."
I stood weakly on unsteady legs, feeling my energy drain. With the last reserves of my battery, I struggled to regain control. My balance sensors went haywire. I tried not to collapse.
We were somewhere at the edge of another galaxy, wherever the Arcon had taken us. Eagle and Everest sat slumped together, unconscious, their heads swaying like lilies floating on the surface of water. The Arcon was moving at high speed, but we were slowly losing momentum, drifting into the unknown.
A ship bearing Federation insignia stopped in front of us, gleaming in ceremonial colors. A woman in white stood on the bridge - her presence suggested a diplomatic mission. Suddenly, in a massive zoom-in, I saw the name tag on the chest of the beautiful, regal woman. It was Mary Twinkle. I felt it more than I saw it, as the image resembled hypnagogic patterns under closed eyelids. The white lady seemed to gaze directly at Captain Lee, who suddenly stirred and managed to cry out into the void,
"Mary! Stop them!"
The captain was shouting like a sleepwalker lost in a dream.
Then, an eerie silence fell over us. Only the sound of the ventilation system remained, a lonely signal of our existence in a galaxy full of mysteries.
I collapsed limply onto the smooth, transparent slab of the floor. Beneath me, millions of stars shimmered, and I - drained of power - felt like I was the last fading star, drifting far from my mission’s objective. The ventilation roared, and I felt as if a gust of wind swept through all my circuits. My emergency alert light blinked red, signaling the shutdown of all non-essential systems. My implant spoke inside my head.
"Vital functions normal. Minimal load. Aria, wake up."
It felt like a cruel joke.
Then, everything went black. It could have lasted a fraction of a second or an hour.
A wave of time, of an ocean - or perhaps just another anomaly - washed over me.
And suddenly, I was standing on a beach.
I remember the scent of the ocean, carried by the wind. A light breeze slipped under my thin, breathable clothing, offering relief in the heat of the day.
Earth felt like a bridge to infinity.
A carefree childhood is the harbor we return to when we face danger in adulthood. Those who lacked joy at the beginning of their lives may carry a deeper sense of abandonment. My mother used to say that.
Now, she stood above me in a wide-brimmed straw hat, draping a pink shawl over her shoulders.
"Megan?"
"Yes, Mom?"
"Be careful with the shells. You don’t want to cut your feet."
"Okay, Mom, but these are just soft corals. Remember our underwater base?"
"Sweetheart, stay here. You forgot your hydroboots. Watch your step and don’t go too deep."
Over the azure ocean, a rainbow-colored aurora stretched across the sky, carrying echoes from the distant shore.
Two massive spheres shimmered in the water’s reflection, their surfaces rippling in the waves.
I pointed between the two moons, their color tinted red by the sun. In the distance, a Federation ship flickered on the horizon.
"Promise me that when I finish the next grade, we’ll land on the other shore. Please," I begged, pressing my hands together in a plea.
"We’ll see what the warm wind brings. It will guide us."
"Mom, at least promise we’ll fly across the ocean. I want to see the unicorn reserve!"
"Look, Megan! A unicorn! At least one - you have an ally. Let’s stay quiet so we don’t scare it away. It’s probably under Federation protection."
"Mom, it’s really a unicorn! Look at its shimmering rainbow mane!"
"They are magnificent, but they’re wild creatures. It could be startled. Or… it could be camouflage. Get back to playing - we need to finish the sandcastle before dinner. Tonight - marshmallow pancakes with strawberries, whipped cream, and mint. "
"Yes, yes, Mom! I’m almost done!"
The breath of Earth surrounded me, sparkling with millions of tiny lights. That day, we could feel the planet’s incredible power, and we could immerse ourselves in it completely. My pupils widened, absorbing the dispersed grandeur of beauty. Other celestial bodies were like distant fruits, hanging beyond the boundaries of our paradise. We only knew the elements that had raised us. There was nothing more beautiful than the love of life. I thought of my father then, but I couldn’t remember his face. Sadness welled up inside me, but I refused to let it take hold. I imagined that my father would return. After all, my mother was the most beautiful woman. My mother and I were like two lonely spirits of women on the beach, calling out for my father. He seemed too far away - or maybe he was deaf to our siren song. Perhaps he had drowned in the ocean of stars. Or maybe… he was already following in our footsteps. I suddenly felt as if my father was near. I promised myself I would find him, even if it meant reaching the farthest edges of the galaxy.
I picked up an old telescope, and through its glass eye, I saw Earth’s capital. The horizon stretched in a wave of pastel colors. The peaks of Federation towers, research domes, flight hangars, settlements of allied species, majestic mountains in the distance - all of it forming a breathtaking landscape. Residential modules nestled together like flowers, covering hills and valleys overflowing with vibrant green. Emerald hills shimmered with the ocean’s breath, bubbling with life-giving oxygen, rising into the sky like soap bubbles. Everything pulsed with an undeniable will to live - stronger than the pull of the darkest black holes. Earth’s defense systems were stronger than any hostile force in the galaxy. Or at least, I believed so. If there was any religion, it was the worship of life itself. My mother and I never gave up. We were the bravest under the Sun of Suns.
At that moment, the telescope completely absorbed my curiosity. From this distance, I could even observe a spaceship launching into the sky. It emerged from a canvas of natural colors, slowly rising toward the upper atmosphere. I thought that my father could be on a ship just like that. They said he was one of the best pilots and officers ever born on Earth. I believed he was as strong as we were here, on this beach. Maybe the Komians had captured him, or perhaps he was in hibernation somewhere in deep space. Maybe, one day, I would stumble upon him during my own captain’s mission when I was older. Adults had their secrets. I wanted to uncover them all - immediately. Even if it meant crossing every ocean at once. I believed that a woman's power can lead me to my father. I wanted to surprise my mother.
"Mom, when I grow up, I’m going to be a pilot."
"Yes, but only when you grow wings. Birds have remiges, you know." She laughed. "First, you need to learn everything important on Earth before you can take off. When you feel your full strength, you can decide. Now, help me call Paris. He should be with Ithar. They might still be in the moon cave. I don’t want them to get lost. They don’t have a nav device. "
"Mom, don’t be like that. Every time someone goes to the cave, you start worrying. Why? They swim just fine. If anything, they’ll just surface on the other side of the rocks."
"I prefer when Snowflake is with them. At least the dog would bark if something went wrong. But they like to play hide-and-seek with me, and I don’t like it. They take unnecessary risks. As a mother, I’d rather keep them close, especially when the wind is picking up. The tide could flood the cave - it’s no joke."
"Mom, let’s just call them together."
From my mother, I knew that awakening one's power meant gradually leaving behind technology and trusting in the life-giving force of light. In moments like these, my mother was overly protective, but she was wiser than us. She had experienced the force of life firsthand. That’s how I came into this world. Children have open hearts. Adults forget that growing up is just the beginning of a journey they themselves once walked. When you’re older, experience supports you - but it also limits you. Mary Twinkle was the best mother in the galaxy. Or maybe even beyond. Some things, you just know. My father was a cosmic hero, but I had to prove it. Then, my mother blew into a pearl shell, sending out a low sound, pulling me out of my thoughts.
"Ithar, Ithar, Ith?! Paris?! I hope they show up soon. I’d rather have them in sight," she said.
"Snowflake! Heel! Come back!"
Our husky tore off, barking, racing toward the towering pines, their aroma thick with resin. He must have been drawn by some other scent, though, otherwise he would not have left. From the ocean, a rainbow cloud began drifting toward us.
"We should head back to the forest," Mary said, trusting her motherly instincts.
In a sudden flash of sunlight, I saw something between the trees. It could have been a telescope, crystals, or maybe even the boys.
"The unicorn is gone, just like the boys. We’ll have to head back, so hurry up, sweetheart."
"Okay, Mom, just two more towers and it’ll be done."
My magnificent sandcastle was almost finished. I picked up my pink cup with the elf design, stretched it open to its full size, and built the last two towers to guard the moat. As I crouched, above the battlements, sunbeams tangled in the clouds, revealing purplish, moon-like formations floating in the sky. They looked like enormous raspberry plantations, covered almost completely in fruits. I imagined that this was a pantry, full of desserts drifting toward my castle upon my command – a sky plantation. At that same moment, I saw dolphins, their high-pitched calls echoing between the granite sky and the foaming indigo waves, darkened by deep-sea plants reacting to the shifting weather. Meteorologists' forecasts could not curb our longing for the ocean, but it was time to head back. We always knew when the ocean called us.
My castle was built from several domes, both large and small, with a dozen towers surrounding it, all encircled by a moat. Inside, there was a courtyard where I could sit and eat pistachios, tossing the shells onto the rooftops and the path leading to the castle. I imagined my family was safe and prosperous, and our fortress always carried us to places where we could play and ride unicorns, bathe in warm waters, explore caves, and climb the highest peaks - where we could witness sunrises and sunsets before anyone else.
I glanced at the courtyard, where, that morning, the dog had left his giant paw print. Just in time, I had managed to push him away and save my castle. But in truth, I wanted someone to save me and my family - a hero I had never met. My sister, Sharon, had once again been sent to Earth 2 to study botany. Or at least, that’s what I was told. I didn’t know what could be more beautiful in the entire galaxy than the green homes on fertile lands, but if there was something, I had made up my mind to discover it.
The idyllic afternoon was suddenly interrupted by the sound of alarm shells. Beachgoers scattered across the area started calling out to one another. Massive, feathered clouds slowly swallowed the aurora. It was time to go home - to our earthship. Biotecture was our home, at least in the capital where we lived. The Federation of Planets was our home, too, and I couldn’t leave the galaxy until I was at least ten years old. But even if I could, my mother would have stayed on Earth anyway. She loved it more than anywhere else in the universe - or maybe she had another reason. Every flower in our garden was her creation. Sharon was supposed to take care of the flowers, and I was supposed to become a pilot. At least, that was my dream.
The next moment, I was holding a telescope. The Eye of Truth became one with me, and my hearing sharpened. I could see and hear everything happening among the bushes, right by the cave. Waves crashed against the rocky cliffs, spilling into the dark cavern beyond. On one of the rocks, I spotted Federation guards - it looked like an ambush.
Two uniformed figures called out, "Commander?"
Then, the taller one shouted, "Hands up! Are there any children in there?!" pointing his weapon toward the cave.
"The children are safe!" someone replied.
"Surrender! Where are the children?! We know they’re with you!"
"I saved them! They were already very weak," the voice answered defensively.
"Don’t try anything stupid! Do you have hostages?!"
"I only saved them! They wanted to surface on the other side of the rocks, but they ran out of oxygen. They got stuck in a crevice! They’re right beside me, alive! They’ll confirm everything. Stand down."
"Officer, do not resist. You have the right to remain silent."
"I also have the right to defend myself! I am a citizen of the Federation!"
The telescope lens fogged up, and in the distance, I heard thunder. I grabbed my mother’s hand and felt the cold coin she always held. I looked around again - there was still no sign of Ithar and Paris. A wave of fear crept in. Had something happened to them?
A sudden burst of lightning interrupted the conversation in the distance. I saw the uniformed officer standing on the rock, arms raised, before dropping to his knees. He looked familiar. I adjusted the telescope to focus on the beach by the cliffs.
There - just meters behind the captured man - Ithar and Paris were crouching. They looked terrified, afraid to move. They must have all emerged from the cave earlier, but I had missed it. The guards fired a laser shot at the suspect, instantly neutralizing him and trapping him inside a protective energy bubble. He looked as if he were encased in a shimmering cocoon.
"Maybe one day, he’ll break free from it like a butterfly," I thought.
For now, he was most likely facing trial. A shiver ran down my spine.
The Guardians of the Legacy ran toward the boys.
"Are you hurt? Did this man capture you?" one of them asked.
Glancing at each other, they responded almost simultaneously,
"He saved us. Megan was on the beach, watching over us."
"Mom, I don’t know what this man did, but I think we’re safe now."
"Meg, we’ll go get the boys and head home immediately."
"What will happen to him, Mom?"
"He’ll be interrogated. Sweetheart, they might send him to a colony, but like any Earth-born, he would probably want to return home. There’s nothing more beautiful than coming home."
Back then, I didn’t fully understand the meaning of her words or why that man would want to return. I moved my eyes away from the telescope and saw a single tear rolling down my mother’s cheek. She quickly wiped it away, thinking I was still focused on my observation.
"The guards signaled to us that the boys will be escorted home. The shells are calling us, my love. It’s time to go. The aurora has completely faded - we shouldn’t waste time."
Snowflake, our beloved husky, began barking - not at the captive, but at the guards. He acted as if he recognized the man and wanted to drive the others away.
"Snowflake! Heel! Come back right now, Snowflake!" I shouted at him.
The last scheduled spaceship landing for today began just as another strong gust of wind swept across the shore. I peeked through the telescope again and saw the captured officer floating in midair, sealed inside the energy bubble. Another rainbow flare appeared in the sky, followed by the glowing silhouette of a spaceship descending onto the water platform. Then, darkness fell around us. I quickly grabbed my pink cup, my mother pulled me by the arm, and my castle collapsed into the sand. She pressed her palm against mine, and inside it lay the coin she had always carried. One side bore the Sun, while the other depicted two moons.
Suddenly, I snapped back to reality aboard the Arcon.
A message flashed on the main screen:
"Aria, wake up!"
Captain Lee Everest pressed something on the bridge console, and a metallic voice rang out.
"Life signs detected below deck. Heartbeat and breathing stable."
"Aria, are you alright? Aria, wake up!"
Slowly, Lee’s face came into focus. I was lying on my side. Beneath me, a thin crack of light spread across the floor, as if ice were fracturing beneath me.
"Aria, activate all life support systems. Come back to us. Restore full power," the captain ordered.
"Eagle, let’s lift her up to relieve the protective layers."
"Captain, is the floor cracking?!" Eagle squealed.
"Feathered croaker, calm down. That’s impossible. Maybe it’s something from outside. Give me the location. Galactic Crossroads. That’s where we are."
"A junction, Captain. The Earth patrols might find us," Eagle whined.
"You're the most out of touch of us all - you have nothing to worry about."
"I’ve had enough of your mocking. We could both end up as exhibits on Earth. Captain, what about Aria?"
"She’s stable, but she might have entered hibernation."
"That’s impossible," Eagle muttered in disbelief.
"Clearly, there’s still much we don’t know about her."
"Take care of Aria, I’ll check the crack’s path."
The captain lifted me like a child. In that moment, I felt something I had never felt before. Something unusual. It was like being born again. Could what happened on Earth have been just a dream?
"Eagle?"
"Yes, Captain?"
"Aria is overloaded."
"What happened to me?" I asked, stunned.
"You were gone for a moment, but we lost consciousness too - for some time. We’ll explain later," the captain said curtly.
"Functionality at one hundred percent. I can join you." I didn’t want anyone to sense my weakness or discover where I had been.
"Alright, let’s go together. And you, hunter, keep an eye on the bridge - make sure we don’t have a repeat of what happened before the jump. We should have lost our tail, but let’s be sure."
"Lose our tail? Fine. Understood," Eagle concluded.
As I stepped between Lee and the officer, I took a step forward - and the crack in the floor moved along with me. The captain instinctively jumped back, fearing a hull breach, but I reassured him with a touch - a gesture of tenderness only humans on Earth used. Suddenly, I knew how to do that.
"Captain, please let me go alone. This might be connected to my dream," I said, stopping his reflex to follow.
It was my first dream - if I could call it that.
Lee hesitated but eventually released my fingers, as if reluctant to let me go. He glanced at the palm of his hand. There, for a fleeting moment, was the mark of the Sun of Suns. On my palm, he saw two moons encircled by a ring. His eyebrows arched in silent question.
"Are you sure?"
"Yes, my programming tells me so."
"Take a weapon and be careful."
"I’ll manage," I replied confidently.
The crack on the floor was getting thinner, leading straight toward the wall.
"Requesting transfer beyond this wall."
"Take a hyperspace ID - we can’t afford to lose you. "
"I have it. I’ll check it out."
In a nanosecond, I vanished from the bridge and instantly found myself in a sphere about three meters in diameter, located somewhere below the main deck.
All around me, numerous control panels pulsated with colorful lights.
"Intruder!" my circuits blared in alarm.
A warning flashed - someone unidentified was on board.
Meanwhile, Lee had taken the risky decision to locate the source of the crack on his own. It would be best if I returned to him intact. Through the ceiling, I could feel what he was doing. I could almost reconstruct the path of his thoughts. He was analyzing the marks on our hands. The images of the Sun and Moons had disappeared as quickly as they had appeared. Lee considered the possibility that he was hallucinating. Like me, he wondered if he had fallen victim to an illusion. He also entertained another possibility - espionage. Nothing was more terrifying than a spy and a smuggler suspecting others of smuggling. A vicious cycle. After years in space, your location no longer matters - only the mission does. And that makes suspicion and distrust your second nature.
"Transfer to the main corridor," I ordered.
Suddenly, I materialized in front of Lee, who was struggling - restrained by some stranger who looked like a ninja in a black bio-spacesuit. A two-meter-tall intruder had his back turned to Eagle, unaware of the situation. Our avian companion had once again taken the upper hand. He stood right behind the intruder, blending seamlessly into the main screen, thanks to his camouflage abilities. His legs were hidden behind the control panel, while his torso merged with the darkness of space displayed on the screen. His camouflage instinctively activated in moments of danger. Just in time. The survival instinct of birds might just save us. Eagle, however, was trembling underneath. I could feel his shaking reverberate through my core. Something had broken today. Not just the floor. Something inside me. Like an imprint of the past on my palm, which now seemed warm with blood. For a brief moment, I felt as though the blood of Earth’s ancestors was flowing through me.

    title: "Stalemate in Hades",
    plot: "In the previous episode:\n A glitch occurs. For the first time, the message Aria, wake up is displayed. Aria is transported to the past, to the year 3052, on Earth 1, in the Moonstone Galaxy. She experiences the memories of a girl, Megan Twinkle, and her mother. A fugitive Federation commander is arrested. Aria's consciousness returns to the Arcon in the year 3158. The crew discovers an energy sphere hidden beneath the deck through a crack in the cockpit floor. Before reaching Hades, a masked ninja appears.",
    content: `Chapter 3
Entry continued on the 55th day of the Year 3158 of the New Era, at 9 p.m. Earth time. The Arcon is located in an unregulated quadrant beyond the Federation’s control, at the Hades base, on the former route to New Antarctica.
In the abyss of the galaxy, everything is shrouded in mystery. That evening, we came face to face with yet another masked opponent - a Ninja. The worst part was that we were still trapped between the Federation agents and Empton’s revenge. Their pale, slender bodies, square heads, piercing horizontal pupils, and snake-like agility - these were the modern-day Emptonians. Their predecessors were said to be even uglier and crueler.
Another time jump occurred. We traversed a week’s worth of time in just one Earth day. The Moonstone was on the horizon. Time stretched and rippled like a comet’s mane. From the asteroid belt, we reached the galactic border, following the old route to New Antarctica. Long ago, this stellar corridor was heavily guarded by the Federation - until it became the path to Hades.
We were all disoriented, even the Arcon, which continued to feed us event scenarios while remaining partially outside our control. It looked like sabotage. Some unknown force - perhaps the sphere beneath the deck - was disrupting the ship’s systems. I stood before the Ninja, uncertain of the future - just like everyone else on board. Time froze for us. Suddenly, from the depths of the floor, the sphere emitted a pink beam, paralyzing the intruder. The light dimmed ominously in the cockpit, then a series of stroboscopic flashes slashed through the darkness, capturing our terrified figures in various poses. Something - or someone - was playing with us. The lights returned as suddenly as they had vanished, blinding us with an intense pink glow. There was a calming force within it - one that suppressed aggression.
"Arcon, weapons status?" Lee asked.
"Defense systems out of control," the ship responded.
In an instant, Eagle lost his camouflage, Lee straightened up, and the Ninja was hurled toward the emergency hatch, as if sucked into a vacuum. He slammed against the titanium outer plating with a loud thud.
"Aria, situation report," Lee muttered, his voice strained.
"The sphere beneath us has neutralized the intruder," I replied matter-of-factly. Then I turned to the most likely scenario.
"This could be an agent sent by the Federation. Arcon, report on the foreign passenger."
"The data suggests he has a mission or a resource of valuable cells, necessary for survival in an unknown atmosphere. The intruder has been classified as a lost artifact," the interface responded.
"He could have been trapped in the sphere but escaped onto the deck during my transfer," I said, exchanging a knowing look with the captain.
"The sphere might be defending access to the hatch where the intruder is stuck," Lee concluded, a deep line of thought forming on his forehead.
"Arcon, activate security protocols," Lee ordered. "Let’s stay on alert until we understand what’s going on."
"Crew safety: fifty percent. An unknown force controls half of the ship’s defense systems."
"Acknowledged. We leave it at that," the captain responded.
"Eagle, are you alright?" I asked, my voice carrying an unusual level of empathy.
"I don’t feel uplifted, but I’m alive. This is impressive. Sneaking onto the ship like a freeloader? And the sphere is on our side? Then, I suppose camouflage is unnecessary." Eagle added a touch of mockery in the face of danger, deliberately downplaying the problem to help himself adjust to the situation.
Eagle’s predatory nature made his moods compulsive, but I was beginning to appreciate his adaptability. As a golden eagle, he once had no greater enemy than humans - yet he had joined us. Beast or bird, survival instinct was his ally, even in the vacuum of space. Together with him, at the mercy of the Arcon, we were slowly regaining balance.
"Regeneration required. Crew health status demands immediate action. Engaging autopilot," Arcon announced. Or maybe - it was the sphere speaking through the ship.
We had no choice but to be patient. The sphere put us all to sleep within minutes, and we entered hibernation - standing upright. Several Earth days passed, and the ship felt as if possessed by a foreign force. When we woke, we weren’t fully aware of what had happened. We felt relatively safe, and the Ninja had been reprogrammed by the sphere into a harmless state. At least, that’s what the logs said. For now, the intruder remained silent, and we had no full access to him. We decided to take him to Hades. Let the President of the Fallen loosen his tongue. After several failed attempts, we removed the Ninja’s mask. He was covered in thick fur, resembling a primate, and his posture shifted into that of a hunched creature. His two-meter stature shrank to barely a meter and a half. After checking our vital signs, the Arcon - likely under the influence of the sphere - hibernated us once more. But this time, each of us was escorted by the interface to our respective quarters. Several hours later, I was the first to wake up. My repair program activated, stimulating activity in my cerebral lobes. I awoke with a jolt of terror. Without hesitation, I rushed to the captain’s quarters and called out:
"Lee! Wake up, we need to talk! We’re all in one piece, but you need to explain something to me. You’ve been avoiding this subject for a while, but I have a few questions. How exactly did you buy me?"
Lee rubbed his eyelids and squinted.
"What do you want, Aria? Give me a moment. Where are we?"
"Getting closer to Hades. Something pulled me out of regeneration. Otherwise, I wouldn’t have woken you up. I need answers. I’m missing some strategic data."
"One thing at a time, Aria. First, we need to interrogate the intruder. If he’s an old enemy, he could be an even greater threat." Lee sat comfortably in the middle of the bed and commanded the Arcon:
"Ensure that the foreign passenger remains restrained."
"Confirmed. Neutralizing the intruder. Threat level at one percent," the interface responded.
"Lee, tell me - how did you get here? For some reason, I can’t access the records of Arcon’s purchase. I need your help." I said in a tone of sincere plea.
"Fine. Arcon, retrieve all logs related to the ship’s acquisition and replacement parts. Exclude crew-related purchases."
Then he turned to me.
"Aria, use your access code and check if we’re still connected to the sphere. We need to regain full control of the ship. The purchase records must be here somewhere."
"Captain, it’s starting to make sense. I have access to the sphere," I said, as realization struck.
"Aria! Wake up!"
The voice of the Arcon boomed, resonating through the entire hull like a thunderclap of metal.
"Oh no! Not again?!"
This time, it was smoother than the last awakening. It wasn’t another malfunction, but rather a seamless integration of my circuits with the sphere, granting me access to Arcon’s old logs. It felt like solving a Rubik’s cube in Einstein’s hands - a once insurmountable puzzle now reduced to a boring and predictable game. I stared into the iridescent walls of the sphere, yet at the same time, I was right beside Lee. I couldn’t explain it, but it felt as though I was beginning to bilocate. The captain seemed unusually irritated, though he masked it well. Everything he felt, he conveyed to me in a single glance. I once again had access to his thought patterns and emotions. It felt like rummaging through his closet - a place I wasn’t sure I wanted to be.
It reminded me of our first encounter, when I was chained to the floor of a hangar, losing power bit by bit, slowly dying in a forgotten mechanic’s warehouse at the abandoned Prometheus port. I had lost hope. Then, Lee appeared - with an empty ID tag and eyes full of stars. A disgraced officer wandering through a mildewed spaceport, hunting for scrap and spare parts. At that time, I was nothing more than a pile of components to scavengers and smugglers. Yet somehow, Lee saw a soul in me. I had barely escaped recycling. Some said the Arcon was haunted, others claimed it was infested with nanobots. A horror story. They didn’t know how to handle me. A primitive tribe of hybrids, unable to distinguish an agent from a decoy - cheap black-market implants. Lee was burning with planet fever back then, still wearing his shiny black boots - the only remnant of his Fleet service. He arrived carrying a sleek black toolbox, like a galactic mobster. He activated every diagnostic scan available, attempting to haggle my price down to scrap value. I felt a mix of disgust and admiration. He was proud of his find - once, the Federation Heirs’ finest research vessel. And I, Aria, the lone navigator. Not a trace of aging, hundreds of missions, yet zero respect - a laughingstock of the galaxy. Nothing could have humiliated me more than decommissioning. I knew every trade route in the Federation, I understood humans better than they knew themselves. I provided entertainment, satisfied desires, indulged every whim - all for human vanity. They created me, yet now they discarded me like a broken toy. That was human nature. Luckily, in that hopeless moment, someone exceptional appeared.
I remember the first time Lee looked at me, the way his brow furrowed in surprise, his bloodshot eyes scanning my remains. He tried to act indifferent. The ship couldn’t reach hyperspace, so the clever buyer said that the Arcon and I were fit only for cadet training or as a floating dormitory among the rocks - on a planet where even hybrids refused to reproduce. His wild mane and warrior stance left no doubts - he was a fighter, but also lost. Keeping his composure, he simply shrugged. He told the junk dealers he would try to fix me, but if he failed, he wouldn’t waste a single token on salvaging the Arcon. He wanted two for the price of one - me and the ship. After all, we were one organism. Jake, the senior mechanic, immediately dropped the original asking price, practically giving the ship away for less than half the tokens. A nightmare has no price.
"The ship already cost me a middle finger! I’d rather sell it at a loss than part it out!" he barked, furious. He pressed his finger implant to his lips, silencing the captain.
"That finger was worth more than this scrap heap!" he spat. "And you still can’t afford it!"
"We’ll see about that," Lee responded, smirking. "Besides, I still have a real middle finger if negotiations go south."
The mechanic’s face turned red with rage. Nobody knew how to ignite me, how to break my lock codes. Lee took on the challenge. He was figuring me out, slowly uncovering my strengths. Running a scanner over my hull, he traced the protective layer, reaching the interface module. That’s when he realized the truth - that I wasn’t just a ship, but a symbiotic system. And that conversation - the one he forced his way into - has never ended.
Ironically, the Arcon, as a research vessel, had never even passed diagnostic tests. Its solar panels hadn’t seen light since the last magnetic storm. How many years had it been? Like a human deprived of sun and rain, I was trapped at the bottom of a tin can with no expiration date. My hero, my captain - a dodger, but from a good planet. He bought me for a fraction of my worth. Even a pig can stumble upon a pearl in this galaxy of mangy hybrids, forgotten by the Founders. Earth had always carried a good reputation, but I didn’t know if we would ever return. But I knew one thing. I wanted to see it before I died. One last sunset over the ocean. One last breath of the forest, one last song of the birds. Nowhere else did eagles fly so high. It was worth it - if only for the sanctuaries. Among all the Earth-born refugees, humanoids, androids, and even unicorns, I had found a true loner - Commander Lee Everest. I felt more fatherly care in him than persistence. I discovered that beneath the disguise of a criminal hid a strong character - pushed into the role of a smuggler - an outsider without a homeland. He reeked of Earth’s sweat and wrongdoing, concealing them under a gray jumpsuit - the only color outside the Federation. Beneath that grayness was a man of flesh and blood, without mutations or nanobots. My own guinea pig - I would observe him day and night, and if luck was on our side, I would survive.
The story was interrupted by the crackling of the hull - this time, it sounded serious. Lee, now fully awake, rushed with me to the cockpit.
"Aria! What is that?! Damn Empton! We’re cracking! And this time, for real!"
"To the escape pods!" I issued the command.
Eagle, however, remained completely still. It was as if he had gone into shock, though he was pretending to meditate.
"Arcon, activate emergency mode and assess the damage. Can you prevent hull disintegration?" Lee ordered.
"Five seconds to disintegration and the same to threat neutralization. Outer hull integrity within safe parameters," Arcon responded.
A few seconds later, the alarm fell silent, and the destruction was halted.
"Eagle, were you growing a tree under the deck? What the hell is this?!"
Eagle blinked slowly, then replied with a hint of pride.
"A Douglas fir! From a seed in the gene bank."
Lee's face twitched. "Eagle, that’s not a fern, that’s a monstrosity that could have blown up the ship!"
"Captain, I think I can fix it!"
"You think?! Another second and we wouldn’t even have a single feather left! Did you plan on making a cozy little nest in space? Have you lost your mind? Is this some kind of cosmic nesting instinct kicking in?! Do you even understand what your little ‘experiment’ almost did to us?!"
I saw where this was going and decided to intervene before Lee ripped Eagle apart.
"Lee, I have to admit he’s right. I know how we can fix this. The tree’s growth is being regulated by the central core. If I manage to take control of Eagle’s panel, I might be able to stop it."
Lee exhaled sharply. "Aria, take the panel and teleport to the sphere beneath the deck. You’re the only one who knows what’s happening down there. Humans and eagles don’t have access, do they? Shut down the ship’s afforestation program. Check the core and restore order."
I nodded in agreement. "Let’s find a solution."
Lee muttered to himself, shaking his head. "This is beyond me. Emptonians, and now this? I should have just become a carpenter on Earth instead of flying across the galaxy, playing galactic savior."
I couldn’t afford to burn through my energy reserves trying to stabilize the ship - not with Hades ahead of us. For a fleeting moment, I thought of the safe haven on Earth 1, the one I had seen in my vision. Then, through my connection to the sphere, everything began to stabilize. Maybe it was the Moonstone, or maybe just luck. I was growing more attuned to the sphere. I could reverse the destructive effects of time, but I still couldn’t control it. We all exhaled in relief as the tree began to shrink, slowly fading away. Within moments, it was gone, leaving behind nothing but a single seed and a scattering of needles across the floor.
We set a plan and agreed to stick to it - no splitting up. Once the ship was secured and we docked at Hades, a new opportunity opened before us. An opportunity as risky as a black hole. When we were ready, we gathered on the teleportation platform.
Lee’s voice was steady as he gave the order.
"Arcon, teleport the entire crew of the Arcon, including the Ninja, to Hades."
A strange, unfamiliar sensation of fear flickered around us. I felt it, but I resisted without a trace of malfunction. I was strong again. Before I could voice any doubts, we stood face to face with Jose Spider - the treacherous president who ruled Hades with an iron grip. Jose Spider was always a step ahead of the rest of the smugglers. That’s why he earned the title: President of Thieves. A towering, nearly two-meter-tall man with long blond hair and four arms. Some called him the Four-Armed Bandit, others the Catcher, but everyone knew him as Spider. He was vulgar, cunning, and vengeful. Always surrounded by a group of loyal sycophants and a handful of washed-up freeloaders, Spider had a taste for new faces. But new faces never lasted long here. Extra mouths to feed were a waste of resources on this station. Unless, of course, they belonged to women.
When you have four hands, you can steal and sell four times as much. Spider’s motto was to trust no one. To confuse his enemies, he surrounded himself with beautiful women, ensuring that others envied his power and charm. It was clear that he enhanced his muscles and had invisible implants. His ego wouldn’t allow him to admit weakness, but he definitely had some. He hoarded gadgets from across the Universe and had no mercy for con artists who outplayed him. A blond-haired spider - what a pathetic combination. Only his vile reputation could slightly boost his self-esteem. In the eyes of Emptonians and smugglers like us, he was nothing more than a corrupt piece of galactic trash. The rest of the cosmos was in his pocket, though of course, that pocket reeked of fraud. When someone lost everything or was looking for illegal data or artifacts, they inevitably ended up here.
Hades was an abandoned space station, once belonging to the Federation. Right under the nose of New Antarctica - the hive of the Federation’s armed forces - a nest of parasites had formed, thriving on trade between Emptonians, Ethernals, and other rogue forces from neighboring galaxies, including the Federation itself. Why was it like this? Because the Federation infiltrated the criminal underworld through Hades. At least, that was their plan. Not everything, however, left the station’s armored walls. Spider had been here the longest. Officially, he was a banished outlaw who could disappear at any moment and never be found. But he was addicted - to tokens, women, drugs, and flattery. He had settled in. He had fallen into the illusion of power. Still, he could tell the useful sycophants from those who were trying to rob him blind.
Jose Spider lived comfortably on this junk heap with the worst reputation in the galaxy. The whole place resembled a spider’s web. Just imagining a maze of quarters and corridors stretching thirty miles wide was enough to understand the kind of labyrinth we had entered. Walls dripping with vice, glazed over with the illusion of desire and greed. This was no honest marketplace, but there were valuable things to be found here. The risk, however, might outweigh the reward. The entire station was cloaked in Federation camouflage. All of it was stolen technology, yet taken with the quiet approval of the Federation’s military intelligence. It was all classified, but my data suggested that’s exactly what had happened. A secret military base had turned into a breeding ground for traitors - but this was the only way the Federation could gain access to off-the-record data and gain an edge in their wars against the Ethernals and Emptonians. The other species weren’t as much of a threat - or at least, those two were the most persistent. The Moonstone - that was the only thing that truly mattered to the enemy. The most morally and genetically degenerate races sought to break free and dominate the others. The Moonstone was a promise of freedom and abundance. But I believed they had misunderstood it. The crystals would never let the Federation fall. They wouldn’t serve as a tool for conquest or oppression, nor would they be used to spread depravity. I didn’t believe it, because it was contrary to the legend and my own analysis of the galactic situation.
A moment after the teleport, ordered earlier by Lee, we landed in the middle of a crowd. The gathered onlookers greeted us standing, but there was no applause. Mutants of all kinds, humans, and galactic animals - their pets - had seemingly woken all of Hades. Suddenly, a piercing whistle rang out, and then Spider appeared. He was flanked by four suspicious beauties, dressed in green, violet, orange, and yellow. They stepped onto an elevated platform together. The women, clad in exotic, seductive outfits, were meant to add to his splendor, but they looked more like a four-headed insect at a masquerade - beauties, by Hades' standards. I glanced at Eagle, who had lost weight recently. Motivated to fight, bristling with hostility, yet in this light, he looked like he could be knocked out and devoured by the first scavenger that came along. The Ninja - or rather, the monkey-man - stepped forward. That’s when Lee, fearing a lynching, pulled a fragment of the crystal from his pocket as a gesture of goodwill and announced ceremoniously:
"Silence!"
"I give the floor here!" Spider snapped, irritated.
"We bring a gift for the great Jose! May the Force be with you, President of Hades."
The Ninja was immediately dragged away by a group of guards and placed beside Jose. The master of this marketplace of vanity gazed at the black-clad stranger, locking onto his eyes - the only readable part of his body.
"I can’t believe you were left to rot in filth, and after all these years, you walk through the front door like a king."
"At your service, great Jose," the Ninja bowed low. His pupils began to pulse, shifting between small and large.
The self-proclaimed president gazed at the crowd with disdain, shielding his eyes from the harsh spotlights illuminating the spectacle. He looked more like an overgrown butler than a powerful crime lord. Jose had prepared an arena - where I, Lee, and Eagle were meant to fall. Captured thanks to the Ninja’s betrayal, we were on display, a mockery of heroism for a gathering of brainless hybrids. The seducer and thief had made us laughingstocks before a rabble of outlaws. Spider cast a mocking glance at Lee, but his words were directed at me, his eyes never leaving the captain.
"Aria, don’t you have any guts? Why waste your time on this pathetic loser?" His laughter rang out metallically, likely altered by a synthetic throat implant.
"Jose, let’s not start with insults. Let’s be reasonable. We have business to discuss." Lee was trying to keep his temper in check.
I ran a quick situational analysis and interjected:
"Great Jose, you always get what you want. Your renown has even reached the Galactic Boil, which we recently visited."
I wanted to strike his ego. It was well known that the Galactic Boil had crushed the Federation outsiders waiting in the Moonstone Nebula for a chance to escape or strike back. However, they were too weak militarily and lacked the telekinetic prowess of the famed humans from Earth 2. In their desperation, they sought help from this clown - but charity had never been part of his business model. Jose finally looked at me, then ceremoniously raised all four arms, along with the four women accompanying him. He cast a lordly gaze over us before closing his eyelids and muttering with fake politeness:
"Artificial, yet so beautiful and intelligent. I would take you as one of my women. You would fight by my side. But I fear my ladies would be jealous of your ability to regenerate." He lowered his arms, pushed the women aside, and ordered them to wait.
Jose turned to Lee, then sized up Eagle from head to toe.
"And who is this?"
Eagle straightened, his feathers bristling. "I am Eagle. I’ve dealt with men like you before. We have more in common than you might think. I, too, have an Emptonian appetite for spoils. I serve no one. I once led my own squadron. I am a mercenary. I believe we can find common ground, great one."
Jose narrowed his eyes, lowering his voice. "Do you realize you’ve flown straight into my web?" He turned sharply toward the Ninja. "Tell us now - who are you?"
The Ninja knelt and spoke, his voice calm but filled with venom.
"I am your servant, my lord. On my planet, we deemed Earth a failed evolutionary experiment. These fools believe themselves to be the saviors of the galaxy! They’re so generous, they didn’t even notice when I sold their own ship."
The monkey-man pulled off his balaclava and tore open his suit, revealing thick, black fur spreading across his chest. A flicker of shock crossed Jose’s face as he suddenly realized Eagle was vanishing before his eyes. It looked like a sleight of hand - a trick performed by interstellar illusionists.
"Weapons on these insolent frauds!" Jose roared.
Eagle had activated a time-looped transmission, teleporting himself back to Arcon. Jose, caught off guard, hadn’t managed to disable the teleportation. The entire crowd, their faces twisted in mocking grins, trained their weapons on us.
"How do you plan to get out of this?" Jose sneered, his voice thick with excitement. "Go on, impress me!"
Lee remained unnervingly calm.
"I recently brushed against an Emptonian checkpoint. Are you still interested in capturing Johnny Em?"
"I’m getting impatient. The monkey-man hasn’t told me everything, has he?" His gaze darkened as he glanced at the Ninja, eyes filled with disdain.
"Jose, do you want us as enemies, or do you want to get to the real ones?" Lee asked, his irritation creeping into his voice.
"I make the rules here!" Jose shouted, spitting in his excitement. "Monkey! Why do I know nothing of this?!"
The Ninja immediately knelt, lowering his head. "Oh, great one," he stammered, his voice trembling. "Can you forgive this oversight?"
Servitude is not an insult - lies are. The stars forgive deceivers, but first, they cleanse them painfully of their filth. Only then can they follow the path of the Moonstone. After all, we all took our first steps from there.

End of Chapter 3.
